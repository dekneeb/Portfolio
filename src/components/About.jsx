            <p className='paragraph'> Hello! My name is Denee (Den-ay), I'm glad you've found my portfolio. The genesis of my web development interests came about during the pandemic when I did an introspective look and complete career overhaul. I recently completed an Immersive Software Engineering course with General Assembly.  Presently I'm seeking a work place that will challenge my current skill set, and foster an environment of learning and growth. I gravitate towards backend engineering, but am capable of full stack development. 
            
            Hello! My name is Denee (Den-ay), I'm glad you've found my portfolio. Let me tell you a bit about myself.
 
I’ve searched high and low for a career I’m passionate about. During my professional career I have worked in both the healthcare and real-estate fields and while I learned a lot from both, it was not until recently that I truly discovered the career I was meant to pursue.
 
Coding has completely changed the vision I have for my life. Having recently completed General Assembly’s 500+ hour Immersive Software Engineering course, I’m seeking work where I can flex this new-found coding muscle. I want to be helping to produce high-quality, optimized code in an environment which supports learning, growth, and innovation.

Outside of work, I’m always striving to shape myself into the best version of me. This means always prioritizing a healthy body and mind so that I can be at my best when nurturing important aspects of my life like work and my relationships. I have carried this mentality into any job I have worked and have been an asset in all positions I’ve held as a result. Now, as I embark on my career in tech, I hope to find work with an organization which values its people, invests in their futures, and builds a bad-ass product.

I’d love to talk with you if you are interested.</p>
